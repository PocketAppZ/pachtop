# ðŸ’¯ Motivation

The inspiration for Pachtop stems mainly from using [Stacer](https://oguzhaninan.github.io/Stacer-Web/) which is a comprehensive System optimizer and monitoring solution. Although, Pachtop does not implement any system optimizer functionality (yet!), It provides more in-depth metrics and information about your system. I wanted to create a similar application to Stacer but with a more modern UI and a more robust codebase. I also wanted to learn Rust and this seemed like a good opportunity to do so. If you hadn't guessed, Pachtop is named after the legendary [top](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top_(software)>) linux program that displays information about CPU and memory utilization. Pachtop will always remain open-source and free to use.
